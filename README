----------------------------------
The deeper meanings of how to play
----------------------------------

You always have twice the numer of rockets aviable as the numbers of enemys on 
the screen. (1 enemy -> 2 rockets; 2 enemys -> 4 rockets ....) You only can fire 
again if the old rocket is exploded, so aim carefully if few enemys are around. 
Bomb: As soon as you get 4 rockets, you can release all rockets at once using 
the bomb key (b). 
Rockets have a random chance to be reflected from walls. 
Hitting an enemy with a reflecting rocket gives you  more Score-points for being 
skilled and lucky.
Rockets turn into red color after ~ 1 Second. 
Try to avoid collisions with red rockets as self-shooting results in 
negative Score-points.


About the power-up's
====================
Every power-up spawns on a random position on the screen and is shown as a question 
mark for a short while. 
Shooting down question marks result in a negative Score-point for being 
too trigger-happy.
Shooting down a not-question-mark has no effect on your Score (except while being 
stoned, see below), but the Power-up will explode.

Debian
======
The mighty debian power-up (red swirl) destroys all enemys on the screen with 
red laser beams.

Wine
====
The wine power-up (red wine) confuse the enemys so that all enemys stand still 
wondering where you are for a short time.

Hemp
====
The hemp Power-up (green leave) is actually a Power-Down and makes you "stoned". 
While you can still shoot rockets at the Aliens, the rockets become "stoned" (green color) and act rather funny.
Because of the peaceful hemp-consuming context of being stoned,
you get no points for hitting the Aliens with the rockets. 
Because of the change of focus and values while being stoned, you get points
for picking up more hemp. You get negative points for shooting at hemp-power-up's.
The percentage of time playing "stoned" is listed in the highscore-list.
After some time (20 seconds, indicated by a green circle and slower circling speed
of the hemp icon), you become "clean" again, except if you get another hemp Power-up in time.
The small hemp-symbols will somewhat protect the player from collisions with enemys.
Note that it is still possible to collide with an enemy if there is no little hemp symbol between the player and the enemy.


Ubuntu
======
The ubuntu Power-up (orange circle) will protect the player somewhat from collisions with enemys. A otherwise fatal collision with an enemy will only decrease the number of ubuntu-symbols circling around you. (The enemy will still explode). 
After some time (indicated by a red circle and the circling speed of the small ubuntu icons
rotating around you) all ubuntu-icons vanish, and you have no more protection from enemys.
Note that it is still possible to collide with an enemy if there is no little ubuntu symbol between the player and the enemy.
